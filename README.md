[**Concentration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)) is
a card game in which the player tries to match pairs of cards together by
flipping over only two at a time.

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## Functionality 

The following functionality is completed:

* [x] The cards have a flip animation when tapped on.
* [x] The New Game button picks a new emoji theme for the cards and re-shuffles
them.
* [x] A score is shown at the bottom, giving 2 poitns for every match and penalizing
1 point for every previously seen card that is mismatched.
* [x] The cards have a custom design.
* [x] Portrait and landscape orientations are supported on all device sizes.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a video of the game in action:

## Notes

My biggest challenge was implementing the flip animation on the cards. Given
more time, I would like to implement permanence so that the user can save their
past stats even after quitting the app.
